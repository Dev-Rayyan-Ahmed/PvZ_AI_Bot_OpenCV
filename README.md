# 🌻 PvZ_AI_Bot_OpenCV

## 🧠 Project Description

**PvZ_AI_Bot_OpenCV** is an automation AI bot built using **OpenCV**, **Python**, and **PyAutoGUI** that can autonomously play *Plants vs Zombies (PvZ 1)* using a classic **rule-based logic system**.

The bot captures the screen in real time, detects zombies, sunflowers, and sun resources using image processing techniques, and simulates user inputs to plant the right defenses in response to in-game threats.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎮 **Real-Time Screen Capture & Game State Recognition**  
  Continuously monitors the game screen to detect changes in the environment.

- 🔍 **Template Matching for Object Detection**  
  Uses OpenCV to detect zombies, plants, and sun via image templates.

- 🌱 **Rule-Based Decision Logic**  
  Strategically places plants in a priority sequence:  
  `Sunflower → Peashooter → Wall-nut`

- 🖱️ **Automated Planting with PyAutoGUI**  
  Simulates mouse movements and clicks to plant defenses automatically.

- 🔧 **Modular & Expandable Design**  
  Easily extendable to integrate smarter AI strategies or machine learning models.
